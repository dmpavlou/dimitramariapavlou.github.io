**What Is It?**
<br />
Imagine an app that creates an entire soundscape around your favorite jingle, sound, or piece of music.
The Ambient Soundscape Generator quietly works behind the scenes to bring you real-time ambient soundscapes, 
<br />based on the audio file you provide it with.
<br />
<br />
**Development**
<br />
This application was developed as part of my internship project at Groves Sound Branding GmbH (Hamburg, Germany), for the period September-November 2023.
