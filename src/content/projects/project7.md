**What Is It?**

Imagine an app that creates an entire soundscape around your favorite jingle, sound, or piece of music.
The Ambient Soundscape Generator quietly works behind the scenes to bring you real-time ambient soundscapes, 
based on the audio file you provide it with.

<br />


**Development**

This application was developed as part of my internship project at Groves Sound Branding GmbH (Hamburg, Germany), for the period September-November 2023.
